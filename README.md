# 2DJavaGameEngine
A 2D game engine writen in the Java language. This is just a pet project, it's not made for professional games.


This contains its own scripting language, it currently has no name.

The current scripting function are as follows:

log - This prints whatever comes afterwords in the console, currently does not work with varibles

jump - sends the program to a function name, currently does not return back to the part where it came from

jumpTo - sends the program to a certain line in the program

setImage - changes a GameObject's image, and if it was not already an image it will change it to one

setColor - changes a GameObject's color, and if it was not already a color it will change it to one

playSound - plays the sound given

stopAllSounds - Stops all sounds being played by a GameObject (currently broken)

programStop - exits the entire program

exit - stops the script, like return
